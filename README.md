Readings about Vehicle to Everything

[1][Vehicle-to-Everything (v2x) Services Supported by LTE-based Systems and 5g](https://github.com/build2last/v2x-readings/blob/main/chen2017.pdf)
> In this article, the overview of requirements and use cases in V2X services in 3GPP is presented. The up-to-date standardization of LTE V2X in 3GPP is surveyed. The challenges and detailed design aspects in LTE V2X are also discussed. Meanwhile, the enhanced V2X (eV2X) services and possible 5G solutions are analyzed.Finally, the implementations of LTE V2X are presented with the latest progress in industrial alliances, research, development of prototypes, and field tests.
